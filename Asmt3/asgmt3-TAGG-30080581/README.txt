     /*
     /   This program once called in terminal, will prompt for a user input file to be parsed.
     /    The file is assumed to contain an adacency matrix, and after filtering other other lines
     /    of text, will parse the matrix into an array of integers, finally sending it to a function
     /    containing Dijkstras shortest path algorithm. The results of each vertex, the quickest
     /    path from vertex 0, and the distance of that path will both be printed in terminal & 
     /    saved to the working directory using the file input name in the output text file.
     */

/*   Important Notes:

          - When prompted to enter a text file for input, leave out ".txt", 
               ie: 'ha30', not 'ha30.txt' (excluding quotes )
          - All code that has either been added, manipulated, or otherwise changed from the 
               file given to us with the assignment is marked by " //Task #:"
               and the end of these changes by " //EndTask".
          - Two new functions at the beginning of DijkstrasAlgorithm.java and two at the end of 
               the dijkstras function have been added, plus some modifications to Asgmt3.java.
          - No modifications to FileIO.java were made.
